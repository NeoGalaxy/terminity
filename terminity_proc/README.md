# Terminity Widgets' Macros

Crate defines two procedural macros, `frame!` and `derive(WidgetDisplay)`,
to help you write your apps with terminity's widgets. This is at a very early development stage,
and breaking changes or new macros (as a StructFrame one) are to be foreseen.

Check the docs for more details.
